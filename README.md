# Overview
This mod replaces alot of mods that I felt like combining into one mod. I took the "Apple" approach to configuration, so things might be less configurable than their standalone counterparts, but they'll play nice together. Most settings can be configured in the ProMod tab in the song selection menu, but you can also edit the `UserData/ProMod.json` directly.
